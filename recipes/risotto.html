      Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a
      creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or
      vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and
      Parmesan cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in
      Italy.

    <h1>Steps to make risotto</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the onion
        and garlic in the olive oil until onion is tender and garlic is lightly
        browned. Remove garlic, and stir in the parsley, celery, salt, and
        pepper. Cook until celery is tender, then add the mushrooms. Reduce heat
        to low, and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the milk and cream into the skillet, and stir in the rice. Heat to
        a simmer. Stir the vegetable stock into the rice one cup at a time,
        until it is absorbed.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the rice has finished cooking, stir in the butter and Parmesan
        cheese, and remove from heat. Serve hot.
