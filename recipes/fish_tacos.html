      The fish taco as we know it today, however, has often been credited to
      Baja California, Mexico. This is the version that most of us picture when
      we think of a fish taco. This is filled with battered and deep-fried fish,
      drizzled with spicy mayo, and topped with shredded lettuce, salsa and a
      squeeze of fresh lime.

        Make beer batter: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in
        a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir
        into flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.

        Make white sauce: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl.
        Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny.
        Season with jalape√±o, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.

        Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
